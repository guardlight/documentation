# What is Guardlight?

**Guardlight** is a self-hosted media content analysis platform that helps you evaluate content like eBooks, movies (via scripts and screenplay) and music (via lyrics). It scans your content based on specified themes, topics or word lists and provides insights tailored to your values and needs.

## Motivation

As a Christian, the type of content that I consume are important to me and my family. While many books, movies, series and lyrics come with content warnings, these often focus on general themes like violence, general language, and other warnings and don't always tell the full story and may not cover deeper concerns such as religious mockery or misrepresentation of values. I wanted a tool that could analyze media or any written content and highlight elements that matter to me and my family.&#x20;

**Guardlight** was born out of that need to help my family make informed decisions about the media they consume and I know others do too. Guardlight is designed to do just that.

## How does it work?

1. Upload your content (e.g., eBooks, movie script/screenplay or song lyrics)
2. Choose from predefined themes/topic/word lists or create your own.
3. Guardlight analyzes the uploaded text and provides insightful findings.&#x20;
4. You decide if you want to consume the media.

## What can it analyze?

Guardlight can analyze any written media and can detect specific words, phrases. topics and themes. In the future it can also perform deeper analysis such as sentiment detection, keyword frequency and classification of content based on specified categories/themes/topics.

## Who is it for?

* People who want to review content before consuming it, ensuring that it aligns with their values and preferences.&#x20;
